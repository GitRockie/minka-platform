/*this is a barrel file that re-exports components from the home folder so they can be imported in other files using only the folder path (e.g. './home') instead of the full path to the component (e.g. './home/home.component'). For more info on TypeScript barrel files see https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/main-1/barrel.*/

export * from './home.component';
